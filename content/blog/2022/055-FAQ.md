A few of your more frequently asked questions

## Are there ways to get ERC20 token balance for a given account address?

Yes. There is. In fact, this is one of TrueBlocks' most important features. Simply do `chifra export --statements <address(es)>` or query the API serve with `http://localhost:8080/export?addr=<address>&statements`. 

Note that `chifra export` has many, many other options which produce similarly-informative data such as `--logs`, `--appearances`, `--neighbors`, `--accounting`, and so on. See the entire help file with `chifra export --help`.

## How can you reliably detect ERC20 transfers if four-byte function IDs overlap?

Here's an example: https://www.4byte.directory/signatures/?bytes4_signature=0xa9059cbb.

The purpose of `chifra export` is to extract all transactions necessary to do 18-decimal-place-accurate accounting for a given address (or addresses).

If we encounter such as case (where there is a conflict in the four-byte or event topic), we pull that transaction as we would any other, but...when we query for the accounting (i.e. we query the smart contract for ERC20 balances), we get either an errored response in the conflicting case. This "mistaken ERC20 transfer" will have no value. The transaction may appear in the list of all transactions, but it will have no effect on the accounting.

In other words, regular old-fashioned, off-chain double-entry accounting will comes to the rescue. This is by design because as you point out, it's not possible to be perfect using purely on-chain data.

## Error message: current file does not sequentially follow previous file

When using chifra scrape indexer you may get the above message. What this means is a completely empty block was returned from the RPC. When I say completely empty, this means there's not even a miner address. Our scraper thinks that every block must contain at least one address, but on some chains this is not true (for example, on some private chains).

Alternatively, this sometimes happens when you run `chifra scrape` and `chifra init` incorrectly, although this last issue should be fixed if you've kept up with the latest updates.

You may turn this warning off by editing a per-chain configuration file. Search for the word 'allow_missing' on this page: https://trueblocks.io/docs/chifra/configs/.

The file you want to edit is in $CONFIG_FOLDER/config/<chain>/blockScrape.toml where $CONFIG_FOLDER is dependent on your operating system (~/.local/share/trueblocks for linux, ~/Library/Application Support/TrueBlocks for Mac) and <chain> is the name of the chain you're scraping.

You can find $CONFIG_FOLDER by typing `chifra status --terse`.

Create the above file if it doesn't exist and add the following value (creating the section inside the file if you need to):

```
[settings]
allow_missing = true
```

## The docs say we should use Erigon, may I use Geth (or some other node software) instead?

There's four reasons we suggest Erigon (the last is a deal-breaker).

1. Erigon is MUCH faster syncing -- two weeks vs many months for archive node
2. Erigon takes up MUCH less disc space - 2 TB vs. 12 TB for an archive node
3. Erigon's RPC is faster
4. Erigon natively supports the trace_ namespace. Geth supports it but only through a JavaScript emulator -- tracing is literally unusable in Geth. TrueBlocks needs tracing.

Item 1, is not that bad -- if you have the time to wait.

Item 3, is dependent on which RPC endpoints you use -- particularly tracing.

Item 2 matters immensely to us since we are so focused on running on small, decentralized machines and makes all other nodes not viable.

Item 4 is a deal breaker. Without traces, we would have to re-write the internals of our scraper. Plus, without traces, the "quality" or "completeness" of our solution is seriously compromised. We could index just events (like The Graph), but that will never allow you to reconcile (in an accounting sense) which is one of our priorities as well.
